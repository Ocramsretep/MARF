\subsection{Silence Removal}

Silence removal got implemented in 0.3.0.6 in MARF's
\api{Preprocessing.removeSilence()} methods (and derivatives, except \api{Raw}).
For better results, \api{removeSilence()} should be executed after
normalization, where the default threshold of 1\% (0.01) works well
for the most cases.

The silence removal is performed in time domain where the amplitudes
below the threshold are discarded from the sample. This also makes
the sample smaller and less resemblent to other samples improving
overall recognition performance.

The actual threshold can be a settable parameter through
\api{ModuleParams}, which is a third parameter according
to the preprocessing parameter protocol.

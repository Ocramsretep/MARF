\subsubsection{Description}

This is a basic ``pass-everything-through'' method that doesn't
do actually any preprocessing. Originally developed within the
framework, it was meant to be a base line method, but it gives
better top results out of many configurations. This method
is however not ``fair'' to others as it doesn't do any normalization
so the samples compared on the original data coming in. Likewise
silence and noise removal are not done in here.

\subsubsection{Implementation Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation: \api{marf.Preprocessing.Dummy.Raw}
\item Depends on: \api{marf.Preprocessing.Dummy.Dummy}
\item Used by: \api{test}, \api{marf.MARF}, \api{SpeakerIdentApp}
\end{itemize}

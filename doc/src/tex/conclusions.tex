\section{Review of Results}

Our best configuration yielded \bestscore{\input{best-score}} correctness
of our work when identifying subjects. Having a total
of 29 testing samples (including the two music bands) that means
24 subjects identified correctly out of 29.

The main reasons the recognition rate could be low
is due to non-uniform sample taking, lack of preprocessing
techniques optimizations and parameter tweaking, lack of noise removal, lack or incomplete
sophisticated classification modules (e.g. Stochastic models),
and lack the samples themselves to train and test on.
You are welcome to contribute in any of these areas to make the framework better.

Even though for commercial and University-level research
standards \bestscore{\input{best-score}} recognition rate is considered to be
low as opposed to a required minimum of 95\%-97\% and above,
we think it is still reasonably well off
to demonstrate the framework operation.

# MARF
Modular Audio Recognition Framework

MARF is an open-source research platform and a collection of voice/sound/speech/text and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms written in Java and arranged into a modular and extensible framework facilitating addition of new algorithms.

MARF can run distributedly over the network and may act as a library in applications or be used as a source for learning and extension. A few example applications are provided to show how to use the framework. There is also a reasonably detailed manual and the API references in the javadoc format.

The original homepage is at http://marf.sourceforge.net where the source code and documentation can be found.
